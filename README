WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Gofish is my attempt to boost the performance of the current
gopherds. As such, it is very primitive and very much a work in
progress. However, I do have some design goals. I am running GoFish on
my 'Winder <http://seanm.ca/>. While it is a great machine, it is not
the most powerful machine in the world.

 1) Secure. I do not plan on letting the server run executables.

 2) Fast. At least as fast as a web server. I am using thttpd as my
    benchmark.

 3) Low resource usage. Single process.

 4) Simple. The daemon will only serve files. Directory listings will
    be read from the .cache files verbatim. I think this is an
    important decision. It gives maximum flexibility to the
    users. They can go from the exteme of writing all the cache files
    by hand, to having some form of custom, fully automated file
    insertion program. I plan on providing one such program called
    `mkcache', but it will not be required.


WHAT STAGE IS IT AT?
--------------------

Well, it compiles... it can serve files... I am using it on YOW.

    gopher://seanm.ca

The current mkcache works.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?
-------------------

GoFish is hosted on SourceForge. Go to the project page
<http://gofish.sourceforge.net>  and follow the instructions.


CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS
-------------------

I am currently using the Linux sendfile(2) call to write out the
files. Because of this, I do not process the files. The following
assumption must hold:

  Files must not have any lines containing only a ".".

There is a script called check-files that will verify that the above
is true. If you have changed the GOPHER_ROOT, you must change it in
the check-files script also.


HOW TO BUILD IT
---------------

If you are using the RPMS, you don't have to build it! If you are
using the source RPMS, build it like you would any source RPM. For the
tarball, read on.

  1) Untar the tarball. You should get a gofish-<version> directory.
  2) cd gofish-<version>
  3) ./configure
          or
     ./configure --enable-http
  4) make
  5) su root
  6) make install


OPTIONAL FEATURES
-----------------

GoFish contains an alpha version of a gopher to http gateway. This
feature is disabled by default. To enable the feature:

	./configure --enable-http
