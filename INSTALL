			 GoFish Installation
			 ===================

RPM
---

If you have an RPM for your system, install the rpm and go straight
the to INSTALLATION section.

SRPM
----

If you have an SRPM for your system, just install and build as you
would any other SRPM. Then go to the INSTALLATION section.

TARBALL
-------

  tar zxpf gofish-<version>.tar.gz
  cd gofish-<version>

Checkout out the gopherd.h file to see if you want to change any of
the defaults. If you get them right now, you do not need a
configuration file.

  make all

By default, the files are installed in /usr/local, you can change this
with the PREFIX variable. For example, `PREFIX=/usr make install'. The
Makefile contains other install directories that can be changed.

  su root
  make install

If you want to use the provided init.d script:

  cp init-gofish /etc/rc.d/init.d/gopherd

INSTALLATION
------------

TO run gopherd, you need a root directory for your gopherspace. The
default is /var/lib/gopherd. This can be changed in the configuration
file.

When you are sure things are setup you can start gopherd:

  su root
  gopherd

Will leave it running in the foreground.

  gopherd -d

Will leave it running in the background. There is an init.d script
available. You can run it like so:

  /etc/rc.d/init.d/gopherd start

You may want to add some files for your gopherd to serve. Put them in
/var/lib/gopherd and either run mkcache or create a .cache file.

`man 5 dotcache' for a description of the .cache files.
