THE FUTURE?
-----------

Step one: GoFish as gopher server with http gateway

	+ done

Step two: GoFish as a static web server

	+ done

Step three: Separate CGI server 

	- follows Unix philosophy of simple tools working together
	- can be quickly shut down
	- easier to secure

Step four: Profits!

Step five: Support XML connections and rename it GoFish.net


THE REALITY
-----------

- more configuration
  - http error msgs
  - html header/footer

- doc combined versus common
- doc http
- doc mmap_cache
  - mmap_cache_size

- persistent http connections
  - would have to timeout connections

- flock to logging so mulitple progs can log to the same file
